        including a pizza dough recipe, topping suggestions, and step-by-step 
        instructions with photos.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center ;">Ingredients: </h2>
    <p class="serving"> for 4 servings: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2  cups warm water(600 mL)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>7 cups all-purpose flour(875 g), plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing</li>
        <li>1 teaspoons kosher salt</li>


    </ul>

    <h2>steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml 
            warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. 
            Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside.
            You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it's not essential for a thin crust.</li>
        <li> Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at
             room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough: if you've let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a 
            floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough 
            needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray
             in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and 
             tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the
              preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil
               leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.</li>
